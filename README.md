1. Write static functions to return all permutations of a String using iterative method and
Recursion method. Check if the arrays returned by two string functions are equal.


2. Binary Search the Word from Word List

a. Desc -> Read in a list of words from File. Then prompt the user to enter a word to
search the list. The program reports if the search word is found in the list.
b. I/P -> read in the list words comma separated from a File and then enter the word
to be searched
c. Logic -> Use Arrays to sort the word list and then do the binary search
d. O/P -> Print the result if the word is found or not
